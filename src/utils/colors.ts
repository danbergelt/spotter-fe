/*== brand colors in JS =====================================================

Brand colors in JS, to be used when saving a tag so that the color can be
saved to the database.

TODO --> having issues when using SCSS exports in JS. Would prefer to use that
method (importing SCSS variables directly from SCSS) instead of a JS object (not
DRY)
